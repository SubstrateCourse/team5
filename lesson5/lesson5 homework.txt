我会把OwnedKitties 改成 map   AccountId => Vec<kitty_id>

//transfer kityy to receiver
fn transfer(origin, receiver:AccountId, kitty_id:u32){
    let owner = ensure_signed!origin)?;

    //get the owner's all kitties
    let cur_kitties = OwnedKitties::<T>::get(&owner);
    let cur_kitties_count = cur_kitties.len();

    //find the target kitty and remove it update the map
    if let Ok(index) = cur_kitties.binary_search(&kitty_id){
        cur_kitties.remove(index);
        OwnedKitties::<T>::insert(&owner,cur_kitties);
    }
    else {
        return Err(Error::<T>::NoSuchKitty.into());
    }

    //update the owner's kitty_count and the receiver's map
    OwnedKittiesCount::<T>::put(cur_kitties_count -1 );
    let mut receiver_kitties =OwnedKitties::<T>::get(&receiver);
    let mut receiver_kitties_count =receiver_kitties.len()
    receiver_kitties.push(kitty_id);
    OwnedKitties::<T>::insert(&receiver,receiver_kitties);
    OwnedKitties::<T>::put(receiver_kitties_count + 1);


}

对于买卖可以新增一个KittyPrice map  kitty_id => price

//set kitty's price
fn set_price (origin,kitty_id,price) {
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    ensuer!(OwnedKitties::<T>::get(&sender).contains(kitty_id),Error::<T>::NoSuchKitty);
    KittyPrice::insert(kitty_id,price);
}

//somebody bought a kitty
fn bought_cat(origin,kitty_id){
    
    let buyer =ensure_signed(origin)?;

    //ensuer the kitty is for sale 
    ensuer!(KittyPrice::contains_key(kitty_id));
    
    //ensuer the buyer has enough money to buy the kitty
    ensuer!(buyer.freebalance() >= kittyPrice::get(kitty_id));

    //do as transfer kitty to buyer
    Self::transfer(buyer, kitty_id);
}
